The respiratory system undergoes a diversity of structural, biochemical, and functional changes necessary for adaptation to air breathing at birth. To identify the heterogeneity of pulmonary cell types and dynamic changes in gene expression mediating adaptation to respiration, we performed single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analyses of mouse lung on postnatal day 1 (PND1). An iterative cell type identification strategy was used to unbiasedly identify the heterogeneity of murine pulmonary cell types. Distinct populations of epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells are identified, each containing distinct subpopulations. 

This repository provides code and data to reproduce our scRNA-seq analysis of mouse lung on PND1.
